<h2>Problem:</h2>
<h3>Is Unique:</h3> 

Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.

What if you cannot use additional data structures?



<h2>Solution:<h2>
<h5>DoesStringHasUniqueCharactersWithDataStructure</h5>

Used HashMap to store characters and validate repeat.

Can also use boolean array (as in official solution) to store the value and check the repetition.

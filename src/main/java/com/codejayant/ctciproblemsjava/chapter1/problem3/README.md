<h2>Problem:</h2>
<h3>URLify:</h3> 

Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.
Note: In java, use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.


<h2>Solution:</h2>
<h5>ConvertStringToUrlStandardForSpace</h5>
Assumption:
<br>
String already has space in it for expanding
